# XBI: an XCM-based high-level standard and interface (ABI) for smart contracts

View on Crowdcast: https://www.crowdcast.io/e/substrate-seminar-2/22

## Description

In this seminar, we will explore the power of an XCM-based Binary Interface that extends the XCM protocol to provide an interface for cross-chain smart contract calls, explaining why XCM is powerful but needs to be extended and detailing how XBI offers a
trail-blazing solution.
